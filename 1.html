      <h2>Russian Blue</h2>
      <p>The Russian Blue Cat (Russian: Русская голубая кошка, romanized: Russkaya golubaya koshka), commonly referred to as just Russian Blue, 
        is a cat breed with colors that vary from a light shimmering silver to a darker, slate grey. 
        The short, dense coat, which stands out from the body, has been the breed's hallmark for more than a century.

        The Russian Blue has bright green eyes, pinkish lavender or mauve paws, two layers of short thick fur, and a blue-grey-black coat.
        The color is a bluish-gray that is the dilute expression of the black gene.
